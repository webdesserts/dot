# webdesserts/dot

This "dot" is a collection of dotfiles that I use accross machines. I manage these dotfiles with my own personal dotfile manager, [dots-cli][1]. This repo is primarily for my personal use, but feel free to take insperation from it if you want.

This repo contains:
- bash configs
- A Brewfile with almost every cli & app that I use.
- All my iterm settings
- All of my vscode settings
- A "vscodefile" that contains a list of all extensions that I use with vscode and a  `vscode` bash script to install them
- and more

## Getting Started

If you have the `dots-cli` you can install this dot with the following commands.

```bash
dots add git@github.com:webdesserts/dot.git
dots install
```
